# Testing Documentation

## Testing Strategy
This Library Management Project uses three levels of testing to ensure that the system works correctly.
1. Unit Tests - Testing individual functions.
2. Integration Tests - Checks whether parts of the system work together.
3. System Tests - Verifies a complete workflow of the functions from start to finish.

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests cover the functions related to member management, library operations, and inventory management.
- Integration tests check the interactions between inventory, loans, members, and persistence features.
- System tests verify full workflows in calculating due dates, reloading data, borrowing items, and saving data.

## Text Execution
All of the tests are conducted using Python's `unittext` framework, which can be run through this command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
