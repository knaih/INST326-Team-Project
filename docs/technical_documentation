## Architecture Overview
The Library Management System is organized into modules that have a specific task to perform, allowing the system to read, update, and fix more easily. Each file handles one main responsibility, which is either handling books, members, loans, or events that are then worked together to complete other tasks like checking out books, tracking due dates, and more that allow complete library workflow.

## Module Responsibilities
**library_items.py**: Defines items stored in the library, such as books, audiobooks, etc.
**member.py**: Manages library member data and membership status.
**loan.py**: Handles the amount a member is past due, tracks returns, and manages due dates.
**library.py**: The entire library system, including inventory, members, and loans.
**event.py**: Manages public and private library events.
**library_functions.py**: Shows functions used across the library system.
**persistence.py**: Handles saving and loading system data using JSON files.

## Key Design Decisions
- Designed using object-oriented programming to clearly model real-world library items. (books, members, loans)
- Code split into different files to ensure parts of the system have one main task.
- JSON files are used to save data, making it simple and easy to use with Python.

## Error Handling
- Handles common problems like missing or invalid data.
- Input validation is used to ensure correct ISBNs, dates, and membership status.

## Known Limitations
- System doesn't use a graphical user interface.
- Designed for single-user use.
- Data is stored locally.
