# Library Management System - Function Library

**Team:** Bookworms
**Domain:** Library Management System  
**Course:** INST326 - Object-Oriented Programming for Information Science  

## Project Overview (Domain Focus/Problem Statement)
The project focuses on the domain of Library and Information Management. It focuses on building a system that helps librarians manage and track inventory, memberships, and events efficiently. This system aims to automate library operations such as updating inventory, tracking memberships, due dates, and event types to improve accuracy, organization, and accessibility in a library.

## Problem Statement
Librarians struggle with:
Tracking Overdue Books
Inaccurate Inventory(whatâ€™s in stock and out of stock)
Memberships are not being paid for
Keep track of events (private and public)
